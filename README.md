# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms and performance evaluation metrics.

## üîç Objective

To develop a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions and minimizes false positives using appropriate preprocessing and classification techniques.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Normalize and clean the transaction data  
   - Handle class imbalance using techniques like **SMOTE**, oversampling, or undersampling  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets

2. **Model Training**  
   - Train classification models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
   - Label transactions as **fraudulent** or **genuine**

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Use classification metrics:
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score  
   - Compare model performance and choose the best approach

## üìä Results

The model's effectiveness is judged by its ability to minimize false negatives (missed frauds) and maintain precision in highly imbalanced datasets.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of preprocessing, handling data imbalance, and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics when building fraud detection systems.
